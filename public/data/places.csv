The project was critical for meeting the energy demands of the Ukrainian SSR's industrial heartland.

While the re-evaluation of the RBMK's critical design flaws was the official reason, the decision was primarily a technical and economic one. The extreme radioactive contamination of the entire site, including the unfinished blocks, made any further construction work physically impossible and financially unthinkable.

If the plant, in its finished form, had been put online, half of the energy produced would have been exported to neighboring regions.

This standardized Soviet design was being deployed across the USSR. By the time the project faced serious opposition, construction was still at a very early stage, with the completion level estimated at only 10-15%, consisting mostly of foundational work and infrastructure for the satellite town of Teplodar.\nThe project was officially canceled in 1989. While post-Chernobyl public anxiety and official reports on seismic instability were the stated reasons, the decision was also driven by political and economic turmoil. During perestroika, local politicians in the increasingly assertive Ukrainian SSR used the unpopular project to challenge Moscow's authority and build their own political capital.

Public opinion, which had been fiercely anti-nuclear in the wake of Chernobyl, gradually became divided, with many residents later advocating revival of the project as a remedy to chronic economic stagnation.

The goal was to replace the city's numerous fossil-fuel boiler houses.\nThe project was halted in 1990 following intense public protest. However, the cancellation was also a major victory for the established energy interests in the region. The VAST was a direct threat to the numerous coal and gas-fired boiler houses and their fuel suppliers. In the new economic climate of the early 1990s, the prospect of privatizing these existing fossil fuel assets was far more attractive to emerging business and political elites than completing a state-owned nuclear project.

belene,BELENE UNPP,1987 – 1990; 2005 - 2012	,2 REACTORS VVER-1000/466B,2 BLOCKS CEASED,"The Belene NPP project has a protracted history. The first phase began in 1987, centered on building four VVER-1000/320 reactors of 1000MWe each. This phase reached a completion level of approximately 40% for the first unit's main structures before being halted. The second attempt in 2005 involved two modern VVER-1000/466B (AES-92) reactors. This project was also canceled, but only after the two complete reactor vessels and other long-lead equipment had been manufactured and delivered.\nThe project was first halted in 1990 due to post-communist economic collapse. Its revival and second cancellation in 2012 were the result of complex geopolitical and economic factors. The project was caught between Western pressure to limit Russian energy influence and Russian pressure to complete the plant. Internally, the project was a political battleground, with shifting governments and competing domestic oligarchs using the multi-billion-euro contracts as a source of political leverage. Powerful interests in the existing energy sector, particularly those connected to coal plants and energy trading, also benefited from the persistent delays and eventual cancellation of a major new competitor.",BELENE_AXO,43.638739,25.216469,DIMUM,"DIMUM ESTATE, BELENE, HUNGARY",1980s,"~9,000",SETTLEMENT NEVER COMPLETED,"The community tied to the Belene UNPP is the ancient town of Belene (Dimum). The project did not create a new satellite city but reshaped an old one. Starting in the 1980s, construction brought an influx of workers from across the CMEA bloc, including the USSR and Hungary, nearly doubling the town's population. This created a boomtown atmosphere, with investment pouring into a new residential district and a sense of a modern, industrial future replacing the quiet, agricultural past. Belene's identity became inextricably linked to the promise of the nuclear energy facility being built 7 km away.\nThe cancellations in 1990 and 2012 subjected Belene to devastating boom-and-bust cycles. Each halt triggered a mass exodus of workers, a population collapse, and a spike in unemployment. Public opinion became deeply polarized between those who saw the plant as the only path to prosperity and those who feared its geopolitical and environmental risks. This perpetual frustration has held the community in a state of suspended animation for decades, unable to move forward while the spectre of the UNPP—with its vast, empty site and two unused reactors—looms over its future.","DIMUM ESTATE, BELENE, HUNGARY_AXO"
